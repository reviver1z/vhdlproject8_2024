**Theme 1**
Design the VHDL model (entity and architecture) of the encoder of a home alarm system with 4 zones (zone 1, zone 2, zone 3, and zone 4). The system has one input, sensors, which is a 4-bit vector and represents the signals from the 4 sensors, one sensor for each zone. The signal from each sensor has the value 1 when a breach is detected in that zone, otherwise it is 0. The circuit has 2 outputs: the first output, zone, is a 2-bit vector and encodes the zone where a breach has been detected (zone 1: "00", zone 2: "01", zone 3: "10", and zone 4: "11"). The second output, alarm, is set to the value 1 when a breach is detected in any zone, otherwise it is 0.

**Theme 2**
The given circuit is described by the following VHDL code:
entity circuit is
    port(
        clk, a : in bit;
        x, y : out bit
    );
end entity circuit;

architecture rtl of circuit is
    signal q1, q2: bit;
begin
    y <= q1 and q2; 
    p: process(clk)
    begin
        if clk'event and clk = '1' then
            q1 <= a;
            q2 <= q1;
            x <= q1 and q2;
        end if;
    end process;
end architecture;
Draw the schematic diagram and simulate the behavior of the circuit for the following input sequence a. Assume that the initial values of the signals are 0.
Sketch the waveforms of the internal signals q1, q2, and the outputs x, y."

This task involves creating a schematic diagram of the circuit and then simulating its behavior based on a given input sequence a. After simulation, the waveforms of the internal signals q1, q2, and the outputs x, y need to be drawn.

**Theme 3**
Design the architecture of a 4-bit shift register using behavioral description. The entity of the shift register is:
entity shiftreg4 is
    port(
        clk : in bit;
        sin : in bit;
        dout : out bit_vector(3 downto 0)
    );
end entity shiftreg4;
->The data of the shift register shifts to the right (from the most significant bit to the least significant bit) with the rising edge of the clock signal clk, and the input sin carries the serial input data. The value of the register is available at the parallel 4-bit output dout.

**Theme 4**
Design a binary counter (entity and architecture) with an asynchronous reset input and counts with the rising edge of the clock signal (clk). The sequence of values for the counter is as follows: 0-1-2-3-4-5-10-11-12-13-14-15. After reaching 15, the counter resets to 0.

**Theme 5**
Design a combinational circuit using VHDL which accepts three inputs: two 32-bit vectors, A and B, and a 2-bit function vector, and produces an output Y, also a 32-bit vector. The circuit operates according to the following information::::
function:00 -> Y:A AND B, 
function:01 -> Y:A OR B, 
function:10 -> Y:A XOR B,
function:11 -> Y:A NAND B
